# XyGraph

XyGraph is a reusable WPF-based node graph editor built as a .NET class library, designed to be embedded into other WPF applications.

It provides a visual, canvas-driven system for creating and connecting nodes—similar in spirit to tools like Unity GraphView, Unity Visual Scripting, or Unreal Engine Blueprints—but implemented entirely in WPF and distributed as a DLL.

This project is intended as both a prototype and a foundation for more advanced node-based tooling.
